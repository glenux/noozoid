A terminal-based mindmap editor for geeks.

The name of the project comes from the Greek words _νους_ (mind) and  _ζούδι_ (small animal).

For now, It is a toy project to improve author's skills with the language and its various libraries. **It is very early stage and is not supposed to work (yet). Please don't use it in production.** :warning:
